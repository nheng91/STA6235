Commercially produced ice cream is made from a mixture of ingredients: a minimum of 10% milk fat, 9—12% milk solids, 12—16% sweetener, 0.2—0.5% stabilizers and emulsifiers, and 55—64% water. Air is incorporated with the above ingredients during the mixing process. The finest ice creams have between 3% and 15% air.

A food scientist is investigating how varying the amounts of the above ingredients impacts the sensory rating of the final product. The scientist decides to use three levels of milk fat: 10%, 12%, and 15%; three amounts of air: 5%, 10%, 15%; and two levels of sweeteners: 12%, 16%.

## Categorical Predictors

#### Create Dummy Variables

```{r}
data <- dummy_cols(data, select_columns = c("Sweetner", "MilkFat", "Air"))
```

#### Construct the Model with All Main Effects

```{r}
m <- lm(Ratings ~ Sweetner_12 + MilkFat_12 + MilkFat_15 + Air_10 + Air_15, data = data)
summary(m)
```

#### Is Sweetner a Significant Predictor of Sensory Rating?

```{r}
tidy(m)$p.value[2]
```

**Hypotheses**

&emsp; &emsp; $H_0: \ \beta_{\text{Sweetner}} = 0$ \
&emsp; &emsp; $H_1: \ \beta_{\text{Sweetner}} \ne 0$ \

**Test Statistic**

&emsp; &emsp; $t_0 = `r round(tidy(m)[2, 4], digits=4)`$

***p*-value**

&emsp; &emsp; $p = `r round(tidy(m)[2, 5], digits=4)`$

**Rejection Region**

&emsp; &emsp; Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha = 0.05$.

**Conclusion and Interpretation**

&emsp; &emsp; FTR $H_0$. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that sweetener is a predictor of sensory rating.

#### Is Milk Fat a Significant Predictor of Sensory Rating?
```{r}
full <- lm(Ratings ~ Sweetner_12 + MilkFat_12 + MilkFat_15 + Air_10 + Air_15, data = data)
reduced <- lm(Ratings ~ Sweetner_12 + Air_10 + Air_15, data = data)
(anova1 <- anova(reduced, full))

```
**Hypotheses**

&emsp; &emsp; $H_0: \ \beta_{\text{MilkFat12}} = \beta_{\text{MilkFat15}} = 0$ 

&emsp; &emsp; $H_1:$ at least one $\beta_i$ is $\ne 0$ 

**Test Statistic**

&emsp; &emsp; $F_0 = `r round(tidy(anova1)[2, 5], digits=4)`$

***p*-value**

&emsp; &emsp; $F_0 = `r round(tidy(anova1)[2, 6], digits=4)`$

**Rejection Region**

&emsp; &emsp; Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha = 0.05$

**Conclusion and Interpretation**

&emsp; &emsp; Reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that milk fat is a significant predictor of sensory rating.

## Visualization - Categorical Predictors Only


We have a model with three categorical predictors.
Ratings will go on the Y axis. This is always the outcome of interest.
Milk fat will go on the X axis. This should be something we can treat as continuous; if you have multiple to choose from, choose the one with the most categories.
We can combine the other two predictors (air and sweetener) to create lines:
- Air 5, Sweetener 12
- Air 5, Sweetener 16
- Air 10, Sweetener 12
- Air 10, Sweetener 16
- Air 15, Sweetener 12
- Air 15, Sweetener 16

## Visualization - Interaction
We now will construct a visualization. First, we must decide what goes where on the graph. Let's put milk fat on the *x* axis and create lines with air. Let's remind ourselves of the levels of air:
```{r}
```
We will use levels 5, 10, and 15 in our predictions. Note that if this were truly a continuous variable, we would want to look at the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile. 
```{r}
```
We also will color our observations on the graph by the level of sweetner. We first need to turn it back into a factor variable,
```{r}
```
Now we are ready to graph,
```{r}
```
We can see that as milk fat increases...
We can also examine this the other way, with air on the *x*-axis and milk fat defining the lines. Let's look at the levels of milk fat.
```{r}
```
We will use levels 10, 12, and 15 in our predictions. Like we noted for air, if this were truly a continuous variable, we would want to look at the 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile.
```{r}
```
Now we are ready to graph,
```{r}
```
We can see that as air increases....
